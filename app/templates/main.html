<h3>Hurricane Debris Removal Update</h3>
<p>The City of Oviedo’s Heavy Debris Contractor continues to work in Zone 1(NW Side of Town) with added equipment in the Garden Grove area. Additionally, City crews will continue assisting the contractor in Zone 1; a second crew will clear areas in the southern part of town and a third Recreation and Parks Crew will begin fence recovery. Finally, Republic Services will begin expanded clearing operations in the city’s gated communities. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Solid Waste Update</h3>
<p>Republic Services, Oviedo's regular household waste, recycling, bulk, and yard trash carrier, will continue their service alongside the heavy debris contractor. &nbsp;All bulk, yard and household routes are caught up from storm delays. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not place yard waste in garbage carts or recycling carts. &nbsp;Yard waste cannot be co-mingled with garbage and recycling, as the landfill requires vegetative material to be separated and the recycling facility does not accept yard waste.</p>
<p>Yard waste should only be placed in garbage bags or store bought containers and will only be picked up by the yard waste collection truck. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Citizen Debris Drop off Information&nbsp;</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The City of Oviedo has opened a residential debris drop-off site at the Evans Street Public Works Complex. Hours of operation are 8am to 4pm daily (including Saturday and Sunday) until otherwise notified.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Program</h2>
<p>Resolution No. 3478-17 was adopted October 2, 2017, which approves the establishment of a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program in the City and associated interlocal agreements with the Florida Green Finance Authority, The Green Corridor PACE District, Florida Resiliency and Energy District, and the Florida PACE Funding Agency.  This program offers non ad valorem financing for commercial or residential qualified improvements that will be paid back by the owner with interest through a special assessment on their property taxes.</p>
<p>Qualified improvements offered per statute include energy conservation and efficiency (ex. pre-approved high-efficiency HVAC system), renewable energy (solar), and wind resistance improvements (such as reinforced roofs). Participation in the assessment is voluntary by the property owner. The improvements installed on the owner’s property are financed by the individual PACE agencies and secured by a voluntary assessment levied on the owner’s property. Property owners who wish to participate in PACE agree to repay the financing as a non ad valorem assessment collected on their annual regular tax bill.</p>
<p>There are currently four (4) PACE districts in the State of Florida. Each of the PACE districts is administered by the following third parties.  Please visit the following links to learn more information about the PACE program.</p>
